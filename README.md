### Abstract

This research aims to investigate how various truck roof spoiler designs influence aerodynamic drag. Using a wind tunnel, force gauges, and airflow visualization tools, we will measure and analyze the drag forces acting on different spoiler configurations. The study will involve theoretical calculations of drag coefficients and experimental validation to identify the most aerodynamically efficient design.

### Introduction

Aerodynamic drag is a significant factor affecting the fuel efficiency of trucks. Reducing drag can lead to substantial savings in fuel consumption and lower emissions. Roof spoilers are commonly used to improve aerodynamics by streamlining the airflow over the truck. This project will examine how different roof spoiler designs impact the drag force on a truck model, using both quantitative measurements and qualitative flow visualization.

### Theory

#### Drag Force and Coefficient of Drag

The aerodynamic drag force

$$
F_d
$$

acting on a vehicle is given by:

$$
F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_d A
$$

Where:

- $\rho$ is the air density
- $v$ is the velocity of the air relative to the vehicle
- $C_d$ is the coefficient of drag

- $A$ is the frontal area of the vehicle

The coefficient of drag

$$
C_d
$$

is a dimensionless number that quantifies the drag per unit area of a body moving through a fluid. It depends on the shape, surface roughness, and flow conditions around the body.

- Measure and recored the velocity distribution of the wind tunnel using anemometer.
- Set the wind tunnel to the desired air velocity $v$.
- Measure the baseline drag force

  with no spoiler attached.

3. **Experimentation** :

- For each spoiler design:
  - Attach the spoiler to the truck model.
  - Measure and record the drag force

    $$
    F_d
    $$

    using the force gauge.
  - Repeat the measurement three times for each design to ensure accuracy.
  - Calculate the average drag force for each spoiler.
  - Use the smoke generator or tufts to visualize the airflow around the truck model.
  - Capture the airflow patterns with the camera.

4. **Data Analysis** :

- Calculate the drag coefficient

  $$
  C_d
  $$

  for each spoiler design using the recorded drag forces.
- Analyze the airflow visualization images to identify flow separation, turbulence, and vortex formation.
- Compare the drag coefficients and airflow patterns to identify the most aerodynamically efficient spoiler in different speed.

### Different Truck Roof Spoilers

1. **Standard Roof Spoiler** :

- A simple flat plate attached to the roof of the truck, intended to reduce drag by redirecting airflow.

2. **Aerofoil Roof Spoiler** :

- An aerofoil-shaped spoiler designed to create a smoother airflow over the truck and reduce turbulence.

3. **Vortex Generator Roof Spoiler** :

- Small, fin-like structures attached to the roof to create vortices, which help in reducing flow separation and drag.

4. **Curved Roof Spoiler** :

- A curved spoiler designed to match the contour of the truck’s roof, aiming to minimize the drag by maintaining attached flow.

5. **Adjustable Roof Spoiler** :

- A spoiler with an adjustable angle of attack, allowing optimization of the spoiler angle for different speeds and conditions.

### Conclusion

The research will provide valuable insights into how different roof spoiler designs affect the aerodynamic drag on trucks. By combining theoretical calculations with experimental data and qualitative airflow visualization, we aim to identify the most efficient spoiler design that can contribute to better fuel economy and reduced emissions for trucks.
